# 📁 Multi-Tool Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository is a growing collection of small data analysis case studies using various tools — Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI — depending on the dataset and goal.

Each project folder focuses on a single dataset or topic, and contains exploratory data analysis, visualizations, or dashboards. These are primarily practice projects meant to improve analytical thinking and technical fluency across tools.

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for EDA, visualization, and basic statistics
- **SQL**: Joins, aggregations, window functions for structured query analysis
- **Excel**: Sorting, filtering, pivot tables, charts
- **Power BI**: Visual dashboards using slicers, cards, bar/line charts, DAX, and Power Query (where applicable)

## 🚧 Notes

- This is a **work-in-progress** and will be updated as new projects are completed.
- Not every project uses all tools — the choice depends on the problem and context.
- Most projects were done using **Google Colab** and simple datasets for practice purposes.

## 🧠 Goals

- Strengthen hands-on experience in exploratory data analysis
- Get comfortable working across multiple tools commonly used in data analysis
- Build a personal knowledge base of small, focused case studies
